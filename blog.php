                                <p class="text-justify">In the field of food science and technology, water is an important ingredient influencing taste, rheology and preservation of foods. Research on functional foods is currently popular; however, it is not yet well known that drinking water also has physiological functions, and that there are some health-beneficial effects of water (Shirahata, 2002, 2004). In the past decade, the decrease in the quality of tap water because of pollution of the global environment over time has become a major social problem. Air pollution affects water in soils, rivers, and farm products by acid rain. Chemicals in polluted water are considered to generate oxidative stress in the placenta of pregnant women, and this can cause various types of diseases in new-borns (Obolenskaya et al., 2010). The human body is approximately 60-80% water. The function of water in the body is mainly classified as follows. (1) The water molecule itself: flowing water affects cellular function and both development and functions of organs (Hirokawa, Tanaka, Okada, & Takeda, 2006; Hove et al., 2003), and hydration and Brownian movement of water are fundamentally important for protein function (Iwaki, Iwane, Shimokawa, Cooke, & Yanagida, 2009); (2) atoms and molecules derived from water molecules, such as protons (H+), hydrogen atoms (active hydrogen [H]), hydrogen anions (H-), hydrogen molecules (H2), oxygen molecules (O2), and reactive oxygen species (ROS); and molecules dissolved in water, such as mineral ions, mineral nanoparticles, organic and inorganic compounds, and gases. Functional water is activated water exhibiting specific functions. There are many activation methods such as electrolysis, treatment with a magnetic field, light irradiation, ultrasonication, bubbling with gases, strong water flow and collision, and treatment with some types of minerals or rocks. Functional water is defined by The Functional Water Association of Japan as water in which both treatment and function have been scientifically demonstrated or reproducible useful functions have been demonstrated among artificially treated waters. Among functional waters, electrolyzed water has been mostly investigated. Electrochemically reduced water (ERW) is produced near a cathode and electrochemically oxidized water (EOW) is produced near an anode. Potable ERW is a health-beneficial water as discussed here. EOW is also termed electrolyzed acidic water and is functional water exhibiting a sterilizing action, mainly due to hypochlorous acid, chlorine gas, and ozone (Bari, Sabina, Isobe, Uemura, & Isshiki, 2003) (Fig. 1A). Potable ERW (pH 8-10) is popular as a health beneficial water in Japan. ERW is also termed alkaline electrolyzed water, alkali-ionic water, alkaline cathodic water, and alkaline ionized water, based on its physicochemical and physiological aspects. ERW exhibits an alkaline pH, is hydrogen molecule-rich, and has a negative oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging activity (Shirahata et al., 2007). Studies on the functions of ERW were initiated in Japan in 1931, and its application to agriculture was first attempted in 1954. In 1960, it was applied to medical care as a health-beneficial water, and in 1966, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan admitted that ERW was effective for chronic diarrhea, indigestion, abnormal gastrointestinal fermentation, antacid, and hyperacidity, and it authorized an ERW-producing device. In 1994, to mainly promote electrolyzed water use in society, the Functional Water Foundation was established with the support of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. Hayakawa (1999) reported that rats administrated alkali-ionic water for 8 weeks exhibited a significantly lower amount of total short chain fatty acids in the appendix than that in control rats; however, alkali ionic water did not affect the flora of intestinal bacteria. Rats administrated ERW of pH 10 had a more negative ORP in the intestine than that in control rats. A double-blind placebo-controlled study on the effects of alkali ionized water was performed using subjects who had abdominal symptoms such as pyrosis, dysphoria, abdominal distension, chronic diarrhea, and constipation from January 1996 to January 1999. The placebo control water was purified water obtained from tap water using an activated charcoal filter, which was then electrolyzed to obtain alkali-ionized water. The number of patients was 84 in the alkali-ionized water group and 79 in the purified water group. The patients drank at least 0.5 L of alkali-ionized water of pH 9.5 or purified water per day for 2 weeks. The results showed that alkali-ionized water significantly improved the abdominal complaints. In particular, chronic diarrhea patients who drank alkali-ionized water showed a significantly higher improvement efficacy of 94.1% comparedwith those who drank purified water (64.7%) (Tashiro, Kitahora, Fujiyama, & Banba, 2000). When the Drugs, Cosmetics and Medical Instruments Act of Japan was revised in 2005, a device for preparation of ERW was re-authorized based on considerable scientific evidence as a home managed medical device. The purpose of use was recognized to generate potable alkaline electrolyzed water for the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms. The Japanese Society for Functional Water was established in 2001, and active studies on various functional waters including ERW have been performed to date.<br/>
                                    The biological effect of alkaline water consumption is object of controversy. The present paper presents a 3-year survival study on a population of 150 mice, and the data were analysed with accelerated failure time (AFT) model. Starting from the second year of life, nonparametric survival plots suggest that mice watered with alkaline water showed a better survival than control mice. Interestingly, statistical analysis revealed that alkaline water provides higher longevity in terms of “deceleration aging factor” as it increases the survival functions when compared with control group; namely, animals belonging to the population treated with alkaline water resulted in a longer lifespan. These results provide an informative and quantitative summary of survival data as a function of watering with alkaline water of long-lived mouse models.<br/>
                                    Biological effects of alkaline water were evaluated on a selected population of 150 mice (CD1, by Charles River, Oxford, UK). Pathogen-free mice were purchased and placed in a specific breeding facility. No other animal was present in the room. Contact with animal caretakers was minimized to feeding and watering. The population was divided into 3 groups, each consisting of 50 individuals, as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Group A: 50 mice conventionally fed and watered with alkaline water produced by the Water Ionizer (mod. NT010) by Asiagem (Italy). The Water Ionizer is a home treatment device for producing alkaline drinking water.</b></li>

                                </ul>
                                <p class="text-justify">All procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with the Italian law on experimental animals and were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Padua and the Italian health Ministry (Aut. no. 39ter/2011). Efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.
                                <br/>Result: The experiment consisted in an initial 15-day acclimatization period. After acclimatization, animals (50, group A) were watered with alkaline water (pH 8.5), obtained by the Water Ionizer (Asiagem, Italy), whereas group B animals (50) were watered with water alkalized at pH 8.5 by a concentrated alkaline solution (AlkaWater by Asiagem, Italy) for 15 days. Group C animals (50), control group, were watered with the local water supply. This period has been identified to gradually accustom the animals treated with alkaline water. At the end of the second period of acclimatization, group A and B animals were watered with alkaline water at pH 9.5 (by the Water Ionizer and by AlkaWater by Asiagem, Italy), while animals of group C were watered with local tap water.

                                 <h2>Benefits of Alkaline water.</h2>
                                 <p class="text-justify">Alkaline water is water that is slightly basic. It contains basic minerals such as calcium, magnesium, or bicarbonate. These compounds bind to hydrogen ions in solution, making the water more basic. So, how do we get alkaline water if normal tap water is at about neutral pH? Natural alkaline water sources are usually springs, or a reservoir of natural water underneath the earth's surface.
                                     The rock structures holding the water may have basic minerals, such as calcium or limestone, that leak into the water, increasing the pH. Some companies, such as Poland Springs, have their own springs that they bottle water from. The Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park are examples of alkaline springs. Some companies add minerals to the water to make it more basic.
                                     Water can also be ionized, meaning it is broken up into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions. The hydrogen ions are bound by minerals in the water, which makes the water more basic. However, not all ionized water has these minerals. Tap water that has been ionized will not have a lower pH, because there are no minerals to attach to the hydrogen ions.
                                     Alkaline water enhances the pH level of your drinking water, in contrast to RO water which makes it more acidic. As we've touched on already, RO removes all the minerals but this also has an adverse effect on the pH level.

                                <h3>Basic Information on pH of Water.</h3>
                                <p class="text-justify">pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. The range goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. pH of less than 7 indicate acidity, whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base. pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water. Water that has more free hydrogen ions is acidic, whereas water that has more free hydroxyl ions is basic. Since pH can be affected by chemicals in the water, pH is an important indicator of water that is changing chemically.
                                     <br/>The pH of water determines the solubility (amount that can be dissolved in the water) and biological availability (amount that can be utilized by aquatic life) of chemical constituents such as nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon) and heavy metals (lead, copper, cadmium, etc.). For example, in addition to affecting how much and what form of phosphorus is most abundant in the water, pH also determines whether aquatic life can use it. In the case of heavy metals, the degree to which they are soluble determines their toxicity. Metals tend to be more toxic at lower pH because they are more soluble. So, in alkaline water this toxicity of heavy metals is absent because of its alkaline behaviour.

In accordance to the theory of medical Professor Gato of Kyushu University on Vitamin K (because vitamin K enables the blood calcium to increase), or the consumption of more ionized water, the effectiveness of the increase in the calcium in high blood pressure is most significant. Too many fats in the diets, which lead to the deposition of cholesterol on the blood vessels, which in turn constrict the blood flow, cause most illnesses such as high blood pressure. By drinking ionized water for a period of 2 to 3 months, the blood pressure should slowly drop, because the ionized water is a good solvent, which dissolves the cholesterol in the blood vessels.

The difference is that the medicine can only apply to each and individual case. whereas the ionized water can be consumed generally and its neutralizing power is something which is very much unexpected. Now, in brief, let me introduce to you a heart disease case and how it was cured.
                                                     The patient was a 35 years old male suffering from vascular heart disease. For 5 years, his sickness deteriorated. He was in the Setagays Government Hospital for treatment.
                                                     During those 5 years, he had been in and out of the hospital 5 to 6 times. He had undergone high tech examinations such as angiogram by injecting VINYL via the vein into the heart. He consulted and sought treatment from many good doctors where later he underwent a major surgical operation. upon his discharge from the hospital, he quit his job to convalesce. However, each time when his illness relapsed, the attack seemed to be even more severe. Last year, in August, his relatives were in despair and expected he would not live much longer. It so happened at that time that the victim’s relative came across ionized water processor. His illness responded well and he is now on the road to recovery.”
                                                     Note: In the United States, cardiovascular diseases account for more than one-half of the approximate 2 million deaths occurring each year. It is estimated that optimal conditioning of drinking water could reduce this cardiovascular disease mortality rate by as much as 15 percent in the United States”

                                                     “Eczema is used to describe several varieties of skin conditions, which have a number of common features. The exact cause or cause of eczema are not fully understood. In many cases, eczema can be attributed by external irritants.
                                                     Let me introduce a patient who recovered from skin disease after consuming the ionized water. This patient suffered 10 years of eczema and could not be cured effectively even under specialist treatment. This patient, who is 70 years age, is the President of a vehicle spare parts company. After the war, his lower limbs suffer acute eczema, which later became chronic. He was repeatedly treated in a specialist skin hospital.
                                                     The left limb responded well to treatment, but not so on the right limb. He suffered severe itchiness, which, when scratched led to bleeding. During the last 10 years, he was seen and treated by many doctors. When I first examined him, his lower limb around the joints was covered with vesicles. Weeping occurred owing to serum exuding from the vesicles.
                                                     I advised him to try consuming ionized water. He bought a unit and consumed the ionized water religiously and used the acidic water to bathe the affected areas. After 2 weeks of treatment the vesicles dried up. The eczema was completely cleared without any relapse after 1 1/2 month.”

                                                     “Mr. Yamada, the head of Police Research Institute, suffered from severe allergy. He was treated repeatedly by skin specialist, but with no success. Then he started consuming ionized water. The allergy responded very well and was soon completely cured. No relapse had occurred, although he had taken all kinds of food. He was most grateful and excited about this treatment.
                                                     As for myself, I had also suffered severe allergy. Ever since I began to consume ionized water, the allergy has recovered. Since then, I started a research on the effectiveness of ionized water.
                                                     I discovered that most allergies is due to acidification of body condition and is also related to consuming too much meat and sugar. In every allergy case, the patient’s antioxidant minerals are excessively low which in turn lower the body resistance significantly. The body becomes overly sensitive and develops allergy easily. To stabilize the sensitivity. calcium solution is injected into the vein. Therefore, it is clear that the ionized water has ionic calcium, which can help alleviate allergy.
                                                     The ionic calcium not only enhances the heart, urination, and neutralization of toxins but controls acidity. It also enhances the digestive system and liver function. This will promote natural healing power and hence increase its resistance to allergy. In some special cases of illness, which do not respond to drugs, it is found to respond well to ionized water.”

                                                     “The stomach is readily upset both by diseases affecting the stomach and by other general illnesses. In addition, any nervous tension or anxiety frequently causes gastric upset, vague symptoms when they are under some strain.
                                                     The important role of ionized water in our stomach is to neutralize the secretion and strengthen its functions. Usually, after consuming the ionized water for 1 to 3 minutes, the gastric juice increase to 1 1/2 times. For those suffering from hyperchlorhydria or achlorhydria (low in gastric juice) the presence of ionized water will stimulate the stomach cells to secrete more gastric juice. This in turn enhances digestion and absorption of minerals.
                                                     However, on the other hand, those with hyperchlorhydria (high in gastric juice), the ionized water neutralizes the excessive gastric juice. Hence, it does not create any adverse reaction.
                                                     According to the medical lecturer form Maeba University, the pH of the gastric secretion will still remain normal when ionized water is consumed. This proves that the ability of the ionized water is able to neutralize as well as to stimulate the secretion.”

After drinking ionized water for one month, 15 diabetic patients were selected and sent to Tokyo University for further test and observations.
                                                     Initially, the more serious patients were a bit apprehensive about the treatment. When the ionized water was consumed for some time, the sugar in the blood and urine ranged from a ratio of 300 mg/l to 2 mg/ dc. There was a time where the patient had undergone 5 to 6 blood tests a day and detected to be within normal range. Results also showed that even 1 1/2 hour after meals, the blood sugar and urine ratio was 100 mg/dc 0 mg/dc. The sugar in the urine has completely disappeared.”

The disease has steadily increased in the United States since 1980, and in 1998, 16 million Americans were diagnosed with diabetes (10. million diagnosed, 5.4 million undiagnosed) Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and more than 193,000 died from the disease and its related complication in 1996. The greatest increase-76 percent-occurred in people age 30 to 30.

In accordance with the theory of Professor Gato of Kyushu University on Vitamin K (because vitamin K enables the blood calcium to increase), or the consumption of more antioxidant water, the effectiveness of the increase in the calcium in high blood pressure is most significant. The consumption of alkaline antioxidant water for a period of 2 to 3 months, I have observed the blood pressure slowly drop, due to the water’s solvent ability, which dissolves the cholesterol in the blood vessels.”

He also feels that, through his clinical experience that patients undergoing kidney dialysis should also drink Alkaline Ionic water as well as those patients with kidney disease who do not respond to drugs.
